      Place your guesses in the <b><mat-icon>edit</mat-icon> Guesses Page</b>.

    <li>You may change them only before the match begins.</li>
    <li>You only need to guess who wins, (or a tie).</li>
    <li>
      In knockout games, guess the result up to 120 minutes, not including
      penalties, so a <b>tie is possible</b>.
    </li>
    <li>You can't see what other players guessed before the match begins.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scoring</h3>
  <p>
    The <b>Home Page <mat-icon>home</mat-icon></b> shows you what your friends
    have guessed and how they have scored, in all past matches.
  </p>
  <img class="screenshot" src="assets/screenshots/results.png" style="max-width: 400px">
  <p>
    Each match has a pre-allocated amount of points. The points will be
    distributed evenly between players who have guessed correctly. So the more
    players guess the match result correctly, the less points each player
    receives.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Example: </b> if the match is worth <b>120</b> points, and
    <b>4</b> players have guessed it correctly, they each receive
    <b>30</b> points.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <b>Scoreboard page <mat-icon>list_alt</mat-icon></b> you can see the current standings of all players in your group.    
  </p>
  <img class="screenshot" src="assets/screenshots/scoreboard.png">
  <p>The table is sorted by points, and also shows the amount of correct guesses <mat-icon>done_all</mat-icon>
    , and the number of "solo" guesses <mat-icon>new_releases</mat-icon></p>

    <h3>Match Points</h3>
    <p>The matches total points are according to the stage of the tournament:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Stage</th>
          <th>Points</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr *ngFor="let stage of stages$ | async">
          <td>{{ stage.displayName }}</td>
          <td>{{ stage.points }}</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The less players guess the match correctly, the more points each one gets.
      Therefore, it is a good idea to bet on supprises every once in a while.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scoring a <b>Solo Bet <mat-icon color="accent">new_releases</mat-icon></b
      >, where you are the only player in your group to have guessed the score,
      earns you a substantial amount of points.
    </li>
    <li>
      However, it is not a good idea to look <b>only</b> for surprises. The
      winners are usually those who find the right balance between surprises and
      predicted results (and of course those who guess correctly
      <mat-icon>insert_emoticon</mat-icon>)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Good Luck!</h2>
