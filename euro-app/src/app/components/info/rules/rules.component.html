  <h3>Guesses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Place your guesses in the <b><mat-icon>edit</mat-icon> Guesses Page</b>
    </li>
    <li>You may change them only before the match begins.</li>
    <li>You only need to guess who wins, (or a tie).</li>
    <li>
      In knockout games, guess the result up to 120 minutes, not including
      penalties, so a <b>tie is possible</b>.
    </li>
    <li>You can't see what other players guessed before the match begins.</li>
    <li>
      The <b>Home Page <mat-icon>home</mat-icon></b> shows you what your friends
      have guessed and how they have scored, in all past matches.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scoring</h3>
  <p>
    Each match has a pre-allocated amount of points. The points will be
    distributed evenly between players who have guessed correctly. So the more
    players guess the match result correctly, the less points each player
    receives.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Example: </b> if the match is worth <b>120</b> points, and
    <b>4</b> players have guessed it correctly, they each receive
    <b>30</b> points.
  </p>

  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The less players guess the match correctly, the more points each one gets.
      Therefore, it is a good idea to bet on supprises every once in a while.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scoring a <b>Solo Bet <mat-icon color="accent">new_releases</mat-icon></b>, 
      where you are the only player in your group to have guessed the score, 
      earns you a substantial amount of points.
    </li> 
    <li>
      However, it is not a good idea to look <b>only</b> for surprises. The winners
      are usually those who find the right balance between surprises and predicted
      results (and of course those who guess correctly

  </ul>
  

  <h3>Match Points</h3>
  <p>The matches total points are according to the stage of the tournament:</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Stage</th>
        <th>Points</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr *ngFor="let stage of stages$ | async">
        <td>{{ stage.displayName }}</td>
        <td>{{ stage.points }}</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
